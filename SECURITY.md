# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The docker images are continously patched with new versions considering base images as well. It is possible to rebuild older versions to swapp base images for newer version but that does not necessarily makes the image more secure considering the application itself. 

Keep an eye on release notes for extra information.

Officially built and suported by me:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.3.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.2.x   | :x:                |
| < 1.1.x | :x:                |
